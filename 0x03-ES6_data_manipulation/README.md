# ES6 Data Manipulation
ES6 introduced several features and improvements to JavaScript, including enhanced data manipulation capabilities. The  fundamental concepts in ES6 data manipulation:
1. `Arrays`: Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. ES6 introduced new array methods that make data manipulation more convenient.
+ `map()`: This method creates a new array by applying a function to each element in the original array.
+ `filter()`: This method creates a new array with elements that pass a certain condition.
+ `reduce`: This method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array, reducing it to a single value.
2. `Typed Arrays`:Typed Arrays are a way to work with binary data in a more structured manner. They allow you to work with raw binary data directly.
3. `Set Data Structure`: A set is a collection of unique values. It doesn't allow duplicate values.
4. `Map Data Structure`: A map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key and value can be of any type.
5. `WeakMap`: A WeakMap is similar to a Map, but it allows only objects as keys and holds "weak" references to the keys, meaning it won't prevent the keys from being garbage collected.
