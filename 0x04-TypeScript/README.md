# TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This means you can catch more errors during development and get better tooling support. It was created by Microsoft to address the shortcomings of JavaScript. TypeScript was built on top of JavaScript and as such, every JavaScript file is a valid TypeScript file. It has some cool features that help us build more robust and maintainable applications in less time.
